# tile-game-test

An experiment in building a game with Java. Built as proof of concept to demonstrate the use of tiles, sprites and images, this was a collaborative project between myself and my friend Owan.

## Make targets

* make        # compile
* make run    # start the game
* make clean  # remove the class files

## Playing

Arrows move the guy around, space bar makes a portal (alters the tile to make it passable).
